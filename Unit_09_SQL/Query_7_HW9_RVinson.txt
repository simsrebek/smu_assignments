--employee information by joining tables: employees, dept_em and departments
-- use IN operator for multiple WHERE clause for employees in Sales or Development department
-- the 'ask' states for Sales AND Development - However I find the instructions to be ambiguous. It is my opinion the IN operator should be used and is most effecient.


SELECT e.emp_no AS employee_number, 
       e.last_name, 
       e.first_name, 
       d.dept_name 
FROM   employees e 
       JOIN dept_emp de 
         ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no 
       JOIN departments d 
         ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no 
WHERE  d.dept_name in ('Sales','Development') 
ORDER  BY e.last_name, 
          e.first_name;
